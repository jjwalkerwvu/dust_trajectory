% % sheath_boris_pusher is a way of "cheating" around the 2d nature of this
% % particle pusher to only include  ion flows along the magnetic field 
% % direction. Assuming that the electron flow is negligible in the plasma,
% % and that only the ions are flowing, use vex to store viz information!
% % The viz information does not affect the motion of dust, but it does get
% % used in the output vector w

% If desired, set this up so that vey can be used for ve_phi, or the
% azimuthal electron drift velocity in the event of sheared electron flow
% in the plane perpendicular to B.
